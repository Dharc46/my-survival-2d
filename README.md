## What is it all about?

Remake of a game demo part of a [course leason](https://cs50.harvard.edu/games/2018/lectures/5/) I did back in 2019 at HarvardX.

The game was originally developed with **Love2D Engine**, using Lua as a programming language and featured **infinity dungeon generation** (simulate infinitely transitioning from one room to another)

The main goal for this project is to actually implement a proper procedural dungeon generation.

## Programming Achievements:
* 2D Top-Down Perspective
* Procedural Dungeon Generation (based on Binding of Isaac's Level Generation)
* Procedural Room Generation
* Custom Kinematic Controller (Improved collisions)
* Finite State Machine pattern to manage Entities (Player and monsters) states
* Screen Scrolling (Room transitioning)
* Enemy AI (custom implementation)
* ~~Data-Driven Design (Using Scriptable Objects)~~

## Goals

As mentioned before, the main goal is to make a proper game based on the original prototype, and continue learning and improving my skills as a programmer and Unity developer. The second one, but not the least, is to achive the first goal, **using the best aproches, technics, tools and design patterns possible**.
