Remake version of the game Legend of 50 (Legend of Zelda clone) using Unity Engine

## What is it all about?

In this project I will be porting or remaking to Unity, a game demo developed with the LOVE Engine.

The Game is called Legend of 50, and it's part of a course leason I did back in 2019.
The source code was provided to us, and we had to add some extra features that required a good knowledge about the architecture of the game.

## Some major topics that will be covered are:
* Top-Down Perspective 
* Infinite Dungeon Generation
* Hitboxes/Hurtboxes
* Events
* Screen Scrolling
* Data-Driven Design (Using Scriptable Objects)

My main goal is to continue learning and improving my skills as a programmer and Unity developer. The second one, but not the least, is to achive the first goal **using the best aproches, technics, tools and design patterns possible**, *with the help of the community*. 
Doing so everyone will learn.
